\section{Introduction}
The system will consist of five main components, namely:
\begin{description}
\item [Web Administration Portal] \hfill \\
This is used by authorized staff members to monitor and maintain the system.
\item [Mobile Application (Android)] \hfill \\
This is used by the general user (customers of a restaurant) to view the location of linked Bluetooth devices to track their own children.
\item [Web API] \hfill \\
This is not seen by any person, but is important for the communication between the Mobile Application and the system server.
\item [Reporting] \hfill \\
This is integrated into the Web Administration Portal and may provide some useful statistical information to aid the maintenance of the system.
\item [Embedded Hardware and Prototyping] \hfill \\
This will be the hardware technologies used to signal locations to the Mobile Application.
\end{description}

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The system will track children throughout a specific area (for example, in a restaurant). The children will be wearing some kind of wristband which contains Bluetooth technology that will relay the position to receivers. The position will be overlayed onto a map which is viewed by parents on their mobile devices. The system is to maintain its own database to store the necessary data.\\
Embedded Hardware and Prototyping is mainly a proof of concept (POC) component. The software side of the system is to be focused on during development and the hardware will be incorporated if time allows.\\
An extension in the future, but is out of scope for the project, is a device that is placed on the diners' table that lights up according to which zone the child is currently in.\\
There will be a basic reporting module, available through the web portal to system administrators. It will provide statistics such as which zones are used the most, how often specific customers use the service and whether any of the hardware devices are broken or malfunctioning.
