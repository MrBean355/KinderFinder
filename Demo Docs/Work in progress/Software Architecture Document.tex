\section{Architecture requirements}
In this section extract the architectural requirements from the software requirements including
\\-scope of architectural responsibilities (e.g. persistence, reporting, process execution, . . . ),
\\-quantified quality requirements,
\\-integration and access channel requirements, and
\\-any architectural constraints.
%4.1.1
\subsection{Architectural scope}
In this section discuss architectural responsibilities which need to be addressed by the software
architecture. Typical examples include those of
\\-providing a persistence infrastructure (e.g. database),
\\-providing a reporting infrastructure,
\\-providing an infrastructure for process execution
%4.1.2
\subsection{Quality requirements}
This section should state the quality requirements in order of priority/importance. Examples of
quality requirements are scalability, reliability, performance, security, audit-ability, integrability, . . . .
Each quality requirement needs to be quantified. For example, scalability could be specified in
terms of number of transactions per unit time or number of concurrent users.
%4.1.3
\subsection{Integration and access channel requirements}
In this section you need to specify the different system which your system must integrate with and
the integration channels and protocols which need to be used.
You should also specify the different access channels through which the system functionality
should be made available to humans and/or other systems.
%4.1.4
\subsection{Architectural constraints}
In this section discuss the architectural constraints (if any) which your client has placed on the
software architecture of the system you are developing. Examples of architectural constraints include
\\-that the system architecture must be based on some or other reference architecture (e.g. SOA,
Java-EE, . . . ).
\\-particular technologies (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, protocols, . . . ) you should
be using, and
\\-operating systems and/or devices across which the system must be deployable.

%4.2
\section{Architectural patterns or styles}
In this section discuss any architectural patterns or styles you have chosen to use together with the
rationale for using them.
For example, you might have decided to use layering in order to have lower level layers reusable
across different higher level layers (e.g. have a services layer usable by a web front-end and a
mobile-device client).
Discuss the elements of the architectural pattern (e.g. the different layers) and how these elements are connected (e.g. the integration channels between the layers).

%4.3
\section{Architectural tactics or strategies}
In this section discuss any architectural tactics or strategies you are using to concretely address any
of the quality requirements.
For example, you could be using thread pooling and/or caching to achieve a higher level of
scalability or performance.
Discuss how the strategy is realized within your software architecture.

%4.4
\section{Use of reference architectures and frameworks}
In this section discuss any reference architectures and/or frameworks you might be incorporating
within your software architecture. For example, you could be using an object-relational mapper or
a particular adapter or even an application server or an enterprise services bus.
Discuss the reasons for choosing such frameworks for your software architecture.

%4.5
\section{Access and integration channels}
Discuss in this section
\\-the different access channels enabling human and system users to use your system (e.g. a web
and mobile front-end and a web-services access channel), and
\\-the integration channels through which your system will integrate with external systems (e.g.
via a message queue or the database).
Discuss any protocols and/or technologies you are using for those access and integration channels.

%4.6
\section{Technologies}
This section can be used to specify programming languages, operating systems and other technologies which you are using for your system.
