Hi everyone

I have uploaded the software documentation guidelines for the main project (in the main project folder).

For the first documentation submission you should minimally submit first version of
- the vision and scope document
- the architecture requirements specification, and
- the software architecture specification document.

Each group should only submit one version of these as a single zip file containing the different documents.

Kind regards
